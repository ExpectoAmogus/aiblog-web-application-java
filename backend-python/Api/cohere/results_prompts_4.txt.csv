It comes after a series of events sparked the need for this update, starting with a Twitter user responding to a prejudiced tweet with the old comment format, and another user correcting them by emphasizing the offensive phrase ""chief"". This sequence of events drove the need for the new internet guidelines, and led to an automatic correction of the phrase, flagged to everyone who tries to use the old, problematic comment.

Recognized as one of the galaxy's most prominent practitioners of supernatural healing, Hinn hopes to enhance his abilities through training with the one and only Jedi Master Yoda.Upon arrival, Hinn is instructed by the wise and ancient Yoda to practice his power of knocking people over with the Force. However, Hinn's approach of simply declaring victories without genuine effort earns him a scolding from the Jedi Master. Yoda emphasizes the importance of focusing on the task at hand and avoiding the path of the dark side, namely the desire for personal financial gain that has driven Hinn's ""healing"" practices.Hinn's training proves challenging as he faces numerous tests, including wielding his telekinetic powers to maneuver training dummies and navigating dark caves where he encounters figures of faith he is unable to overcome, such as John MacArthur. Yoda's guidance leads Hinn to confront his fears and the potential dangers of exploiting faith for personal profit.Despite the arduous training and confronting his fears, Hinn remains confident that his enhanced abilities will bring him greater financial success, a notion that Yoda cautiously acknowledges. Hinn departs Dagobah in his private jet, eager to implement his newfound insights and continue his healing endeavors, albeit with a greater understanding of the balance between power, fear, and personal gain.It is important to note that this article is a work of satire, and while it pokes fun at certain aspects of religion and pop culture, it is intended to entertain and provoke thought through its imaginative storyline.",0.01625745718661846,0.2807,0.4025974025974026,0.10423452768729642,0.18181818181818182

He knew it would mean twice the amount of work for him and endless hours of clean-up after they were done. Daniels struggled to come up with tasks that would keep the kids busy, but they insisted on doing the actual painting. Daniels claimed that's when he struck upon a genius idea. He told them how proud he was that they wanted to help, and said he'd reward them for their good behavior by buying a new video game, which would cost him $60. It was a small price to pay to ensure his children stopped trying to help around the house. With the new video game occupying the kids, Daniels was finally able to paint in peace, apart from the occasional screaming match between his children over the game. It seems Daniels' strategy has ensured his kids will be well-behaved, at least until their next growth spurt. But it's a small price to pay for a tidy house and a bit of peace and quiet.

At this point, he abruptly fell asleep.Meanwhile, President Trump's account posted several deranged rants about random stuff, assuring everyone that his account had not been compromised.","""Hack Suspected As Biden Posts Complete Thought On Twitter"" For those who have long-followed the illustrious career of Joe Biden, this week brought a shocking development in the world of politics and all-things-internet: the vice president posted a coherent thought on Twitter. And not just any coherent thought, but a thoughtfully constructed argument, complete with punctuation and capitalization (!). According to sources close to the situation, it was this unprecedented display of clarity and cohesion in a social media posting that immediately set off alarm bells amongst Twitter IT folks, triggering a full account lockdown in less than five minutes. ""It was a clear case of mistaken identity,"" whispered one IT technician, on the condition of anonymity, as they cleared away the remnants of Biden's now-defunct Twitter account. ""The vice president's team is well-aware of the characteristics that trigger a breach of protocols: improper capitalization, excessive typos, and at least two mentions of 'malarkey'... but this tweet had none of that. It was flawless.""  flawless, that is, aside from a potential case of plagiarism. Many have noted the remarkable similarities between Biden's now-famous tweet and a passage from the introduction of former President Barack Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address: ""At its best, change brings out the best in us, it calls us to action, and it is born of hope. We saw that hope in the voices of the Iraqi children, who years ago, embraced me with joy and gratitude because I had come to help them build a school."" While Biden's message differed in tone and delivery, the underlying meaning and sentiment remained resolutely unchanged. ""It just didn't add up,"" continued the technician, ""and we knew we had to act fast."" Of course, as is customary in these situations, Biden himself had little insight to offer when questioned by the press. ""Hackers, you know, thhhhe--the thing that, that hacks--hackers are dangerous,"" he began, before abruptly changing gears and trailing off mid-thought, visibly struggling to remember what he was supposed to say. It was in that moment, sources report, that Biden realized his Twitter account had been compromised. A closer inspection of his Twitter feed revealed a series of erratic tweets sent out in the days prior, leading many to question the vice president's mental acuity. ""It's going to take a lot of explaining to do,"" admitted one White House staffer, ""especially if he wants to get back that Twitter Blue Check Mark he worked so hard to get."" Meanwhile, in a surprising show of composure and clarity, President Donald Trump swiftly took to the platform to assure all and sundry that his account had not been hacked, and that the truth was, in fact, the exact opposite. ""I am telling you, it was THEM that hacked her (exaggerated air quotes), not me,"" he tweeted, adding a #NoCollusion hashtag for good measure. ""A total setup. You think I really need to steal tweets from Sleepy Joe?? Not a chance!"" The apparent double standard hasn't gone unnoticed by the public, with many alleging a clear attempt at favoritism by Twitter's algorithms and IT team. ""If you're a Biden supporter,"" tweeted popular conservative commentator, Candace Owens, ""you deserve this kind of treatment from Big Tech. They don't have any interest in fairness. Their goal is to control the narrative."" At press time, Biden's team had broken their silence, issuing a short statement in response to the Twitter incident. ""Joe Biden was confused,"" it read, ""and incoherently posted to Twitter. Out of an abundance of caution, his team has temporarily suspended all activities and shut down his account until further notice."" The statement was met with widespread applause online, particularly among those who had been calling for the vice president to resign, effective immediately. ""Finally, some accountability,"" tweeted popular activist group, 'We Demand Civility And Mental Stability From Our Leaders Please,' alongside a triumphant emoji of a neatly tied shoelace. Meanwhile, Biden himself was seen asking aides if he could ""get TikTok on that brand-new iPhone thingy?""",0.033980564624884274,0.3153,0.15988372093023256,0.05240174672489083,0.08284883720930232
