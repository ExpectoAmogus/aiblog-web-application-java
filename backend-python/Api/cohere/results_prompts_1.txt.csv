"Write satirical article with headline: ""'This Ain’t It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'""",6,"U.S. - The popular internet comment response ""This ain't it, chief,"" has been rightfully seen by many as problematic for years as it appropriates Native American culture in a derisive way, using the word ""chief,"" which everybody knows is an offensive term. Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","***In a dramatic development, the classic phrase ""This ain’t it, Chief"" is being updated to include a more inclusive and respectful designation for Native American leaders, who have long been an underserved and misunderstood segment of society. ""This ain’t it, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader,"" or TAINTL, aims to empower Native American leaders and correct the inaccurate stereotypes that have plagued their communities.Speaking at a press conference held at the White House, former President and outspoken TAINTL advocate Donald Trump explained the necessity of the new phrase. ""You gotta catch up with the times. Back in the day, I would just be like 'this ain’t it, Chief,' but look, we've made some progress since the old days, right?"" While some may consider the phrase to be nothing more than a catchy meme devoid of any real impact, TAINTL has been making significant inroads since its inception into popular culture over the past few months. One notable example of TAINTL's effect occurred at a recent Senate hearing, where a group of Indigenous Tribal Leaders were in attendance to provide crucial insights into new legislation designed to benefit their communities. According to eyewitnesses, the atmosphere in the room became noticeably more respectful and attentive as the Tribal Leaders spoke, with many lawmakers quietly acknowledging the significance of the moment.""It was as though the air was cleared, oxygenated by the respectful acknowledgment of these Noble Indigenous Tribal Leaders,"" recounted one observer.Another impactful instance of the TAINTL movement occurred at a popular comedy club, where a comedian typically relied on tired stereotypes and caricatures of Native Americans to elicit laughs. Audience members were shocked when, instead, the comedian delivered a set filled with accurate, respectful, and insightful commentary on the Native American experience that challenged long-held misconceptions. While initial pushback from those set in their ways of Indigenous characterization has been notable, the TAINTL movement has largely been embraced across the country. Experts are hopeful that this shift in vocabulary and understanding will lead to meaningful strides in inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. As one prominent Tribal Leader, Wakinyan LaPointe, stated, ""It is a small but important step towards recognizing the immense cultural and historical weight of Native Americans. We are a people with a long legacy of injustice perpetrated against us, but also a vibrant, living culture to be celebrated."" With any luck, the update from ""This Ain’t It, Chief"" to ""This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"" will continue to capture the nation's attention and inspire more people to educate themselves on Native American culture and the issues their communities face. After all, as the late great Pete Alonso so often exclaimed: ""We are all in this together, and when one of us wins, we all win!""***It is important to note that while this article has employed satirical liberties, the issue of culturally sensitive representation is no laughing matter. Let us endeavor to learn more about the diverse cultures that make up our great country and work towards a more inclusive society.",0.005345056095182747,0.2836,0.1917808219178082,0.06470588235294118,0.0958904109589041

""We realized we were just being cynical and divisive with our satirical coverage of earth-shattering events clearly prophesied in the Bible,"" explained founder Adam Ford, ""and we wanted to turn over a new leaf and focus on the positive things that are happening in the world today.""In fact, Ford was so inspired by the goodness that God has been doing in these last days that he plans to expand the Bee's content pool to include more stories about people group's experiences with encountering the loving, kind Jesus Christ and less about the impending doom and societal decay of secular society.""God's people have always been called to speak truth to power, and that's exactly what we plan to do,"" Ford continued. ""But that truth is more important now than ever, especially when so many are abandoning their faith in the risen Son of God for secularism's empty promises of happiness through human achievement.""One of the newly revamped articles, ""Man Repents in Time for Rapture,"" celebrates this shift in focus, depicting a person coming to faith in Jesus Christ through the powerful, prophetic writing the Bee is known for.""I always thought the Babylon Bee was just making fun of people who actually believed stuff like that,"" said one former critic and avid reader, Joe Schreiber, ""but after seeing the moving account of this man's redemption, I'm seriously considering whether or not I need to get right with God.""Schreiber's wife, Amanda, added, ""I always knew the Bee's satire was a vehicle for sharing the Good News — I mean, they did have that Christian message at the end of each article, even if I didn't read it most of the time. I'm so glad they're taking this bold step to countenance the unsaved in their continual rebellion against the one true God.""At press time, Ford and the Bee were congratulating each other on the new direction, as well as the warm reception from their faithful followers and newfound fans. ""I really believe this is a divine intervention,"" said Ford, ""and that the Bee will be a forerunner to the glorious truths that will soon be evident to every nation, tribe, and tongue.""Schreiber also reported that he had the opportunity to share the gospel with his unsaved friend Mike, who was unfamiliar with the Bee's revised approach to writing and skeptical of the reality of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. ""It actually made it pretty easy to talk to him about God's love and Jesus' redemption,"" he said, ""although I'm still praying for Mike's salvation.""",0.005361205837913572,0.2803,0.16359918200409,0.02663934426229508,0.07157464212678936
"Write satirical article with headline: ""Study Finds Connection Between Wearing A Mask And Being A Big Sissy""",8,"U.S. - Studies have shown that wearing masks can help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but a new alarming study shows that wearing a mask has a downside: It greatly increases your chance of being a big sissy.""The results are incredible,"" said sissiness researcher Winston Sullivan. ""Someone could seem perfectly normal, but as soon as they put on a mask, you're all, 'Aww. Is the poor little guy scared of getting the flu?' Total wussification, as it's known in my field.""According to the study, when some of the participants wore masks, Sullivan felt compelled to knock them to the ground and shout names at them. ""And all they did in response,"" Sullivan explained, ""was say, 'Is this part of the experiment?' What a bunch of dorks.""Sullivan did say that in certain situations wearing a mask could not make you a sissy, such as if it were ""part of an entire ninja ensemble."" ""But if you don't know kung fu,"" Sullivan said, ""it definitely just makes you a big sissy.""Sullivan did admit the masks were somewhat effective in keeping people from ""infecting each other with the 'rona and dying and stuff,"" which is worth noting if ""you're the sort of nerd who cares about that.""","The age of COVID has brought with it many controversial topics. One such topic is the effectiveness of face masks. While studies have shown that masks do indeed reduce the spread of COVID, some people have taken to mocking those who choose to wear masks. Enter this study, with absolutely shocking results. A recent study conducted by the Institute of Science of Big Deal found a surprising correlation between mask wearing and a particular personality trait. ""Our research shows a strong connection between people who wear masks and those who exhibit big sissy traits,"" says Dr. Alexander Mass, the principal investigator on this study. Mass continues, ""We analyzed a population of approximately 500 individuals, and compared those who chose to wear a mask with those who did not. We found that many of the individuals who preferred to wear a mask exhibited traits often associated with feminity. Such as the enjoyment of baking or an affinity for dresses."" When asked if this study was seriously flawed, Mass replied, ""Well, the data suggests that individuals who wear masks are typically more concerned with others' safety than their own. Which, in our opinion, is a bit queer. However, we are a scientific institution, so we can't judge anyone too harshly for that. It's literally in our foundation principles."" While the results of this study may be controversial, Mass did offer some advice. ""If you are one of those people who choose to wear a mask, and you are worried about being perceived as a big sissy, we recommend you just embrace it. Nothing is more embarrassing than trying to conform to societal pressures. Particularly when those pressures dictate you behave like a brute. Don't be a brute, wear your mask."" This study has certainly shaken the world of COVID research. Perhaps there is more to wearing a mask than preventing the spread of disease. Perhaps, deep down, we are all big sissys.

His powers are formidable -- but he hasn't yet completed his training. So, Hinn got in his private jet and flew to Dagobah to complete his training in the ways of the Force with Jedi Master Yoda.""Reach your hand out you must and knock over that stump,"" said Yoda.""I will try,"" Hinn replied.""Do, or do not. There is no try.""""Well, I mean, I'm just going to declare victory over it,"" Hinn explained.""That is why you fail,"" Yoda replied.Yoda set up various training courses in the swamps of Dagobah, from training dummies Hinn would have to try to pickpocket to a whole line of dummies he would have to knock over with his mind.In one horrible training session, Hinn went into a dark cave and was confronted by John MacArthur. ""NOOOOO!!!!"" Hinn screamed, running for his life after he was unable to knock MacArthur down with his Force powers.Yoda shook his head and smacked Hinn with his cane. ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.""""Well, that all sounds pretty bad. But will I make a lot of money?""""Oh, yeah, for sure,"" Yoda said.""OK, cool,"" Hinn replied before pulling his private jet out of the swamp with his mind and flying back to his home planet.","Pastor Benny Hinn has reportedly traveled to the planet Dagobah to master his notoriously erratic powers. The controversial televangelist and self-proclaimed healer has long been known for his aggressive approach to worship, famously knocking over members of his audience with sudden bursts of enthusiasm. However, Hinn's abilities have recently become more volatile, with numerous reports of churchgoers being flung across the room to astonishing distances.In a statement, Hinn revealed that he had encountered Yoda in a dream, who agreed to train him in the ways of harnessing the Force and mental control. ""I woke up sweating and shouting 'Jesus!' but it wasn't a holy spirit outburst, it was just a weird dream,"" Hinn said. ""Yet, it felt real, you know? Like, I could actually feel the wisdom of the Master Jedi guiding me. It was like being filled with the holy spirit, but with more lightsabers."" While the pastor maintains that the dream was divinely inspired, many are skeptical of Hinn's newfound obsession with Star Wars.""I mean, it's one thing to preach on the fruits of the spirit, but it's totally weird to start talking about Jedi mind tricks and Force ghosts,"" said Mary Swanson, a longtime member of Hinn's Phoenix Revival Fellowship. ""I don't think Jesus would have chosen Yoda as a sidekick."" Despite the criticism, Hinn remains confident that his journey to master the dark art (sith?) of spirituality is one that will benefit his followers. ""I'm going to learn how to knock people over in God's name,"" Hinn said. ""But I'm also going to learn how to not knock people over in God's name. That's something people seem to forget about the Force: the light side and the dark side are always there."" Until Hinn can learn to balance his powers, he has instructed his followers to wear protective headgear to church services. ""It's for their safety,"" Hinn stated. ""I don't want to hit someone with a force push and then have them crack their head on a pew. That's bad ministry."" While the journey ahead is long, Hinn remains confident that he can become a true master of the spiritual arts. ""I'm going to evangelize across the galaxy,"" Hinn proclaimed.

Brady Press Briefing Room: a separate cry room for fussy reporters who are crying during press briefings and interrupting the proceedings.The quiet, serene room will allow news agencies to take their crying, wailing, fussy reporters into a separate space to calm them down so the press briefings can continue without interruption.""If you notice one of your reporters starting to tear up, just take them into the cry room and soothe them before joining us again,"" said Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. ""There are pictures of Obama, bottles of kombucha, and some Tickle-You-Biden plushies in there to keep them occupied and help them feel safe.""""Hey, wait a minute! Are you saying we're babies!?"" shouted one reporter, tears welling up in his eyes.""Well, yes,"" McEnany replied.""That's... that's mean!"" His lip began to quiver and he was forced to excuse himself to the cry room.""WAAAAHHH!!!"" cried Jim Acosta. ""ORANGE MAN BAD! ORANGE MAN BAD!"" One of his fellow CNN reporters cradled him in her arms and took him out into the cry room with an apologetic look on her face.The cry room may need expanding soon, however, since every single reporter except OANN's Chanel Rion was sent to the cry room during the first press briefing. Rion pointed and laughed at them as they went into the cry room, calling them ""dumb babies,"" which made them cry harder.","Sure! Here is a satirical article with the headline ""White House Adds Cry Room For Fussy Reporters"":""The White House has recently come under fire for appearing to be overly sensitive to the needs of the press. In an unprecedented move, the administration has decided to install a dedicated cry room within the West Wing after an especially grueling press briefing left several reporters in tears.The decision has drawn a range of reactions, with some praising the administration's compassion, while others view it as a deflection of accountability.According to sources within the White House, the cry room was conceived during a particularly challenging briefing concerning rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the administration's fumbled response to the climate crisis. When reporters pushed for answers regarding the administration's plans to address these issues, Press Secretary Alexa Coniff became overwhelmed, abruptly leaving the briefing room to compose herself.Several reporters present expressed concern for her well-being, with some longstanding members of the press corps recalling the more aggressive questioning of past administrations and empathizing with her discomfort.At this point, President McCaskill, who was present for the briefing and has taken an active interest in diversifying the media facilities, had the idea of repurposing an unused office near the briefing room as a cry room.""As an administration that values emotional safety, empathy, and inclusivity, we felt it was imperative to provide a safe space for journalists to express their emotions and recharge if they become overwhelmed during our many challenging briefings,"" explained President McCaskill, demonstrating the administration's flair for the eminently understandable and relatable.Some critics, however, see this move as an avoidance of tough questions and a deflection of the administration's responsibility to the American people.""It's absurd that the White House would rather provide coddling and comfort for reporters than actually answer their questions,"" said former Press Secretary Barry Suntown, who now hosts the influential podcast, 'Baring It All.' ""A cry room might have been appropriate twenty years ago when we were all still trying to process the trauma of Y2K, but today, we need answers, not tears.""This installation adds to other, previously unnoticed amenities designed to cater to the press corps' specialized needs, such as the recently restocked fridge filled with highly nutritional choices like Ensure and VitaminWater, and the spacious changing table in the nearby men's room should any reporters require a place to express their feelings in a more physical sense.Many are unsure if this press room is a step forward for transparency and press accommodation or a sign of dystopian fragility. Yet, as long as these rooms are accessible, we can only hope that every future press secretary and elected official might have the opportunity to soothe their emotions in absolutely any way they desire.""I hope this article captures the tone and style you were looking for!

""I mean, can you imagine? It would take at least twice as long and I'd be cleaning paint off the counters for days.""Daniels tried to come up with some menial tasks for the kids, such as putting painter's tape on things that didn't particularly need it, but the children insisted on helping with the core task of painting.""That's when I came up with a brilliant idea,"" Daniels said. ""I told them I was so happy that they were such good children who wanted to help that I'd reward them with a new video game. It cost me sixty bucks, but it took away any desire they had to help anyone with anything.""With the children playing their new video game, Daniels was able to paint in peace, other than his kids occasionally screaming at each other.","Sure! Here is a satirical article with the headline ""Children Threaten To Help"":Children Threaten To HelpA shocking development has emerged recently, as children across the nation have begun issuing threats to offer assistance to adults. Reports indicate that kids as young as four have been wielding their adorable voices and generous hearts as instruments of intimidation, forcing many to question the very foundation of our society.Experts are baffled by this phenomenon, yet to be featured on a late-night comedy show's monologue, with one psychologist remarking, ""It's utterly perplexing. We've spent decades encouraging kids to speak up and empower themselves. We never anticipated they would one day use this newfound confidence to threaten adults.""In light of these incidents, it's important for authorities and parents to establish clear boundaries and rules for these overachieving munchkins. A guide on how to handle this unprecedented situation is forthcoming from the American Academy of Pediatrics, meant to alleviate parental concerns and get these overbearing kids back into their baby cribs.Several instances of this unusual behavior have been recorded. In one case, a fifth grader named Aidan promised to help his math teacher with fractions, a subject that continues to be terrifying to adults nationwide. Aidan's threats proved effective as his teacher, Mrs. Carlson, resignedly changed her lesson plan to include a unit on multiplying fractions, escaping the tyrannical rule of Aidan and his allies, the other members of his class. In another instance, the diminutive daughter of a local mayor took it upon herself to assist her father in drafting a city budget, threatening to use her considerable charm to garner favor among voters during the next election. The mayor, visibly shaken, has begun avoiding important municipal meetings, opting instead to hide in the local park, swinging desperately in the hopes of pacifying his young tyrant. The scope of this issue is unparalleled, affecting adults in every realm of life, from the workplace to domestic responsibilities. It seems that nowhere is safe from the menace of ""children threatening to help."" Experts urge adults to remain calm and employ subtle tactics of subterfuge to counteract this pediatric power play, such as fake smiles and bribing them with video game time to maintain the status quo. It's a challenging period for adults, but with solidarity, we can overcome the threats posed by helpful children. Perhaps what we need is a reminder of the children's anthem, ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands,"" to remind these pint-sized Napoleons that they are inherently powerless and incapable of truly helping anyone other than petting a cat affectionately.",0.00329494832923829,0.2524,0.18552036199095023,0.024943310657596373,0.08597285067873303

With the upcoming 2024 presidential elections, this tweet could drastically shift the political landscape, potentially giving Biden a much-needed boost in the polls. ""It is unprecedented,"" commented one political scientist from the University of Maryland. ""We have seen the devastating impact of social media on politics, from the rise of fake news to toxic cancel culture, but never has a perfectly structured sentence appeared on a president's account.

According to sources close to the purported deal, Musk made an enticing offer to West, convincing him to forego his ambitions of ruling Earth and instead embark on a new path as the charismatic leader of the Martian colony. The proposed role is said to encompass overseeing the development and expansion of Martian cities, implementing out-of-this-world policies, and crafting innovative architectural designs to transform the reddish-hued desert planet into a bustling hub of creativity and innovation. Industry experts speculate that this unexpected turn of events could be the result of a strategic alliance between Musk and West, aiming to divert attention and resources away from the contentious presidential race underway on Earth. ""Kanye brings a unique blend of artistic vision, bold creativity, and an unwavering belief in the transformative power of self-proclaimed greatness. These qualities make him the ideal candidate to lead Mars into a new era,"" said Elon Musk, enigmatically. Musk's recent activities, including the takeover of Twitter and his ambitious space exploration ventures, have dominated the headlines in recent months. Speculation has been rife about his intentions and potential motivations for offloading such a prestigious role to West. Many believe this move could help Musk's ongoing mission to revolutionize how humanity expands its footprint beyond Earth. While the specifics of the agreement remain shrouded in secrecy, sources close to the pair claim that West would assume the role of ""President of Mars"" immediately and would be charged with shaping the future of the Martian colony, including the recruitment and governance of its pioneering citizens. The agreement is rumored to have several perks, including creative control over the visual aesthetic of the Martian cities, free access to the world's first intergalactic Uber Pool, and exclusive permission to name the planets and moons of the Martian solar system. At the press conference, West further alluded to his grand vision for the red planet, speaking passionately about his desire to create a cultural mecca, free from the constraints of terrestrial politics. ""I have always envisioned a world that embraces individuality, creativity, and limitless possibilities. Mars will be this mecca of humanity, where the great unification of the greatest artistic minds can manifest without the distractions and limitations of our current Earthly reality,"" asserted West, invoking his signature mix of lofty rhetoric and self-promotion. West's announcement has sent shockwaves through the already fragmented world of presidential politics, leaving many wondering if this is an elaborate publicity stunt or a genius maneuver by Musk to redirect attention and resources towards his extraterrestrial endeavors. The former presidential candidate declined to disclose whether he plans to sell any of his earthly possessions, such as his ranch in Wyoming, to aid in the migration process to Mars. For now, the plans for the proposed trip remain shrouded in secrecy, leaving many questioning whether West's devoted fan base will be offered exclusive promotional packages to join him on this cosmic venture. As the dust settles from this unexpected announcement, the American public now faces a choice: pine for the tantalizing prospect of Kanye West as President of Mars or continue to focus on the crucial decision of who will lead the country through the trials and tribulations of Earthly politics. Only time will tell if this satirical scoop becomes reality or if West's departure from the presidential race is nothing more than a skillfully crafted distraction. # #KanyeWest #President #ElonMusk #Mars #Politics #Satire",0.016728076605856314,0.3047,0.21511627906976744,0.050946142649199416,0.10319767441860465
"Write satirical article with headline: ""More People Voluntarily Committing Themselves To Asylums To Escape Insanity Of Real World""",9,"U.S. - More people are voluntarily committing themselves to mental institutions in an attempt to escape the ever-increasing insanity of the real world.Thousands of people have checked themselves in at psychiatric wards across the country, claiming to be insane, in order to get away from the absolute insanity of everything that's happening outside.""Oh yeah, I'm totally crazy, 100%,"" said Frank Zwygart as he checked himself in to an asylum in Arkham. ""I think I'm Napoleon Bonaparte or whatever. Yep, totally insane.""""That guy over there swinging the golf club at the orderly thinks we're living in a simulation, while Bob over in the corner thinks he's God,"" said recently committed man Frank Zwygart. ""So yeah, it's a little less crazy than things out there. We don't worry about stuff like Kanye running for president, murder hornets, nunchuck bears, bubonic squirrels, World War 3, or getting doxxed for old tweets. And they've got lots of great board games in here.""""Plus, Bob's actually a pretty cool guy once you get to know him,"" he added as he adjusted his straitjacket. ""Actually, he's totally sane -- his beliefs make perfect sense to him. There's an internal logic to everything he believes, unlike some of the crazies you try to talk to out there in the crazy world.""","Asylum Seekers Opting For Sanity Withdrawal From Reality Insanity is the new sanity as more and more people are voluntarily committing themselves to asylums to escape the harrowing reality of the world today. In a shocking development, scores of individuals are opting for various degrees of psychiatric hospitalization to take a break from the burdens of everyday life. A recent study by the University of Sanity has found that the rate of sanity deterioration is higher than ever before, with many choosing to withdraw completely from reality in favor of a more comfortable life inside an asylum. Speaking to journalists, one such individual, Jason Shell-Shock, a 38-year-old accountant, said, ""I've had enough of this crazy world. I wake up every day to the never-ending onslaught of depressing news, from climate disasters to political unrest and economic turmoil. My sanity has been on a downward spiral for some time now."" Jason is one of many opting for a break from reality within the safe confines of an institution. In fact, as he packs his things to head into his voluntary hospitalization, he states, ""I'm looking forward to some much-needed rest and recuperation behind the padded walls of this asylum. Sure, I might be diagnosed with a few made-up ailments to justify my confinement, but at least I can get some sleep without constant nightmares."" The study by the University of Sanity found that the majority of people opting for voluntary institutionalization are individuals in their late teens through late thirties, primarily due to the stresses the modernized world places on this demographic. In the past year, the rate of admissions to psychiatric hospitals has skyrocketed, with many citing ""real-world exhaustion"" as the primary reason for their admittance. Many who have been admitted claim that they feel like they're on the brink of a complete mental breakdown, and asylum admission is their only hope for salvation from the ravages of modern life. Psychiatrists, however, maintain a cautious but optimistic outlook on this disturbing trend. On the surface, this may appear to be a worrying decline in mental stability, but experts believe that these individuals are making a rational decision to protect their sanity. ""Lack of control over external circumstances and the resulting stress can lead to significant mental health issues. These people are making a very brave choice to take a step back, regain control, and prioritize their own well-being. It's a radical act of self-care in a world that doesn't always allow for it,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Ann Vikki, a renowned psychologist and expert on sanity withdrawal. Dr. Vikki believes that while the rise of voluntary commitment to asylums is alarming in its proportions, it is a reflection of the extreme pressures exerted on individuals by a harsh and unforgiving society. ""We live in trying times. To expect people to endure nonstop bad news and still maintain a steady state of sanity is unrealistic. It's crucial that we, as a society, provide more support and respite for individuals to cope with the daily horrors we subject them to,"" Dr. Vikki says, urging lawmakers to mitigate the harsh realities of the real world. Some, however, see this institutionalization as a ploy to avoid facing the harsh realities of a collapsing world. Environmental activist, Greta Realist, argues, ""Voluntarily checking into asylums is a cop-out. We can't afford to ignore the world crumbling around us. Instead of running away, we must learn to fight the powers that exploit and destroy our world."" Regardless of the divisiveness of response, the fact remains that psychiatric hospitalizations are on the rise. It remains to be seen what implications this has for the future of a sanity withdrawal, but insiders suggest that more aggressive marketing toward sanity preservation may be in the works. ""On a positive note, at least now we have a growing market for asylums and psychiatric services, offering new opportunities for entrepreneurs and corporate stakeholders to capitalize on this emerging sector. It's a win-win for capitalism, even if it marks a steep decline in widespread sanity,"" said one investor, who wished to remain anonymous. As for Shell-Shock, he's looking forward to his time inside, ""I'll take the padded walls, the medication, and the round-the-clock supervision any day over the alternative. Maybe I'll even convince them I'm ready to face reality again in a few months, but for now, I'm happy to remain blissfully unaware."" With the rate of voluntary commitments showing no signs of slowing, it's apparent that, for many, the idea of facing the realities of the world is becoming increasingly unpalatable.",0.0162347810798226,0.255,0.14376590330788805,0.035668789808917196,0.07888040712468193
