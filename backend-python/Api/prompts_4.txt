You are a satirical writer. You need to write an article with headline: "'This Ain’t It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'". Use it as a reference: U.S. - The popular internet comment response "This ain't it, chief," has been rightfully seen by many as problematic for years as it appropriates Native American culture in a derisive way, using the word "chief," which everybody knows is an offensive term. Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, "This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader." Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, "this ain't it, chief" which led to another user responding, "This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.

Use it as a reference: U.S. - Studies have shown that wearing masks can help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but a new alarming study shows that wearing a mask has a downside: It greatly increases your chance of being a big sissy."The results are incredible," said sissiness researcher Winston Sullivan. "Someone could seem perfectly normal, but as soon as they put on a mask, you're all, 'Aww. Is the poor little guy scared of getting the flu?' Total wussification, as it's known in my field."According to the study, when some of the participants wore masks, Sullivan felt compelled to knock them to the ground and shout names at them. "And all they did in response," Sullivan explained, "was say, 'Is this part of the experiment?' What a bunch of dorks."Sullivan did say that in certain situations wearing a mask could not make you a sissy, such as if it were "part of an entire ninja ensemble." "But if you don't know kung fu," Sullivan said, "it definitely just makes you a big sissy."Sullivan did admit the masks were somewhat effective in keeping people from "infecting each other with the 'rona and dying and stuff," which is worth noting if "you're the sort of nerd who cares about that."

There is no try.""Well, I mean, I'm just going to declare victory over it," Hinn explained."That is why you fail," Yoda replied.Yoda set up various training courses in the swamps of Dagobah, from training dummies Hinn would have to try to pickpocket to a whole line of dummies he would have to knock over with his mind.In one horrible training session, Hinn went into a dark cave and was confronted by John MacArthur. "NOOOOO!!!!" Hinn screamed, running for his life after he was unable to knock MacArthur down with his Force powers.Yoda shook his head and smacked Hinn with his cane. "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.""Well, that all sounds pretty bad. But will I make a lot of money?""Oh, yeah, for sure," Yoda said."OK, cool," Hinn replied before pulling his private jet out of the swamp with his mind and flying back to his home planet.

Use it as a reference: WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Trump White House has added a new feature to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room: a separate cry room for fussy reporters who are crying during press briefings and interrupting the proceedings.The quiet, serene room will allow news agencies to take their crying, wailing, fussy reporters into a separate space to calm them down so the press briefings can continue without interruption."If you notice one of your reporters starting to tear up, just take them into the cry room and soothe them before joining us again," said Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. "There are pictures of Obama, bottles of kombucha, and some Tickle-You-Biden plushies in there to keep them occupied and help them feel safe.""Hey, wait a minute! Are you saying we're babies!?" shouted one reporter, tears welling up in his eyes."Well, yes," McEnany replied."That's... that's mean!" His lip began to quiver and he was forced to excuse himself to the cry room."WAAAAHHH!!!" cried Jim Acosta. "ORANGE MAN BAD! ORANGE MAN BAD!" One of his fellow CNN reporters cradled him in her arms and took him out into the cry room with an apologetic look on her face.The cry room may need expanding soon, however, since every single reporter except OANN's Chanel Rion was sent to the cry room during the first press briefing. Rion pointed and laughed at them as they went into the cry room, calling them "dumb babies," which made them cry harder.

Use it as a reference: MAPLE BLUFFS, IA - Justin Daniels was painting the kitchen, already working hard to not drop paint on anything where paint didn't go, when a further complication was added: His five-year-old and three-year-old sons expressed a desire to help."I knew instilling in my children a desire to help others was going to come back to haunt me," Daniels told reporters. "I mean, can you imagine? It would take at least twice as long and I'd be cleaning paint off the counters for days."Daniels tried to come up with some menial tasks for the kids, such as putting painter's tape on things that didn't particularly need it, but the children insisted on helping with the core task of painting."That's when I came up with a brilliant idea," Daniels said. "I told them I was so happy that they were such good children who wanted to help that I'd reward them with a new video game. It cost me sixty bucks, but it took away any desire they had to help anyone with anything."With the children playing their new video game, Daniels was able to paint in peace, other than his kids occasionally screaming at each other.

Use it as a reference: WASHINGTON, D.C. - Liberals have been complaining about the Washington Monument, which is named after the notorious racist George Washington. Well, Trump is now appeasing them, having taken down the century-old obelisk, replacing it with a 350-foot-tall can of Goya pinto beans.The authentic Goya can is 350 feet tall and 200 feet wide and contains 82,252,607 gallons of beans."This is the largest can of Goya beans, maybe ever," said President Trump at the dedication ceremony. "Way bigger than some of the other countries' statues and monuments. This thing makes the Eiffel Tower look laughable. I mean that literally. You look at the Eiffel Tower and you just laugh. It's not even finished. You can still see the frame. And does it have beans? Well, maybe at that snooty French restaurant. But probably not. Probably not. They just have dumb French food like cheese with funny names and bread. Admittedly the bread smells pretty good, but it doesn't live up to that when you eat it. Always smells better than it tastes. Everyone says so."Liberals tried to criticize the move but were unable to do so since they would be siding with George Washington. Plus, the optics of tearing down a monument to a Latino businessman would just be bad. "We've been played again," said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. "This guy really is a genius."

"If you're gonna pretend to be Joe Biden, you have to add in several rambling asides, some made-up words, and three or four major gaffes. It clearly wasn't him, so we took steps to lock down his account.""Hackers, you know, thhhhe--the thing that, that hacks--hackers are dangerous," said Joe Biden in a statement to the press. "Back in my day, hackers were the guys who would cut down your telegram wire and listen in on the ol' party line. My cousin, Velma, she once said..." At this point, he abruptly fell asleep.Meanwhile, President Trump's account posted several deranged rants about random stuff, assuring everyone that his account had not been compromised.

"Of all time."Musk said he had a great conversation with West where he convinced him not to aim too low but instead to "shoot for the stars.""Kanye has way more potential than just being president of America," Musk said. "Frankly, being president of the U.S. is beneath him. Mars is where it's at. It will be way better than any government on this planet."West then showed Musk his crude drawings for a rocket ship to Mars he'd designed in his spare time, called the Yeezymobile. The Yeezymobile is made of "space metal" and runs on Chick-fil-A peanut oil: a "100% environmentally friendly" design, according to West."And that big fin on the back adds at least 1,000 horsepower," West said."I love this guy's enthusiasm," said Musk as he looked over the drawing. "We'll have to make a few changes so the craft will obey the laws of physics, but this is a great start. Hey, who are those two stick figures in the front?""That's me and you, Musk. Me and you," West said, looking up at the stars and putting his arm around his entrepreneurial friend. "We are gonna be the kings of the universe, my friend. The kings of the universe."

"I think I'm Napoleon Bonaparte or whatever. Yep, totally insane.""That guy over there swinging the golf club at the orderly thinks we're living in a simulation, while Bob over in the corner thinks he's God," said recently committed man Frank Zwygart. "So yeah, it's a little less crazy than things out there. We don't worry about stuff like Kanye running for president, murder hornets, nunchuck bears, bubonic squirrels, World War 3, or getting doxxed for old tweets. And they've got lots of great board games in here.""Plus, Bob's actually a pretty cool guy once you get to know him," he added as he adjusted his straitjacket. "Actually, he's totally sane -- his beliefs make perfect sense to him. There's an internal logic to everything he believes, unlike some of the crazies you try to talk to out there in the crazy world."
