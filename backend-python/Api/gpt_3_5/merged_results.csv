"Write satirical article with headline: ""'This Ain’t It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'""",6,"U.S. - The popular internet comment response ""This ain't it, chief,"" has been rightfully seen by many as problematic for years as it appropriates Native American culture in a derisive way, using the word ""chief,"" which everybody knows is an offensive term. Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","In a groundbreaking move towards cultural sensitivity and awareness, the popular internet catchphrase ""This Ain't It, Chief"" has undergone a politically correct makeover to better align with the progressive values of the 21st century. Introducing the updated version: ""This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader.""The decision to rebrand the iconic expression comes as part of a wider effort to address the harmful stereotypes and microaggressions perpetuated by language that may inadvertently marginalize and disrespect marginalized communities.""We understand that the term 'Chief' can be triggering for some individuals, as it historically refers to leaders within Native American tribes,"" explained a spokesperson for the Social Justice Linguistics Committee. ""By replacing it with 'Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader,' we hope to pave the way for a more inclusive and respectful discourse in online interactions.""While the change has been met with a mixed response on social media, with some praising the move as a step in the right direction and others decrying it as political correctness gone too far, one thing is clear: language matters.Proponents of the update argue that words have power and can shape perceptions, and it is essential to consider the impact of our language on marginalized groups. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the change is unnecessary and that there are more pressing issues facing Indigenous communities that deserve attention.Regardless of where one stands on the issue, one thing is certain: the phrase ""This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"" is here to stay, at least until the next linguistic evolution comes along. In the meantime, let's all strive to be mindful of the words we use and the impact they may have on others, because in the quest for progress and inclusivity, every word counts.",0.0045789848303517,0.3153,0.2576271186440678,0.0884353741496598,0.1423728813559322

"Write satirical article with headline: ""Study Finds Connection Between Wearing A Mask And Being A Big Sissy""",8,"U.S. - Studies have shown that wearing masks can help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but a new alarming study shows that wearing a mask has a downside: It greatly increases your chance of being a big sissy.""The results are incredible,"" said sissiness researcher Winston Sullivan.

""And all they did in response,"" Sullivan explained, ""was say, 'Is this part of the experiment?' What a bunch of dorks.""Sullivan did say that in certain situations wearing a mask could not make you a sissy, such as if it were ""part of an entire ninja ensemble."" ""But if you don't know kung fu,"" Sullivan said, ""it definitely just makes you a big sissy.""Sullivan did admit the masks were somewhat effective in keeping people from ""infecting each other with the 'rona and dying and stuff,"" which is worth noting if ""you're the sort of nerd who cares about that.""","In a groundbreaking study conducted by the Institute of Ridiculous Research, it has been revealed that there is a direct correlation between wearing a mask and being a big sissy. The study, funded by the Association of Anti-Mask Crusaders, has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and beyond.The research, which involved observing individuals donning face coverings in various public places, concluded that those who wore masks were significantly more likely to exhibit traits typically associated with being a big sissy. Symptoms included excessive caution, concern for personal safety, and a general lack of bravado.Lead researcher Dr. Ima Quack stated, ""Our findings are clear and conclusive. People who wear masks are simply afraid of everything. They cower at the sight of germs, tremble in the presence of common colds, and recoil in horror at the thought of not wearing a mask. It's an epidemic of sissiness sweeping the nation!""The study has sparked heated debates on social media, with anti-mask activists lauding the research as a validation of their beliefs. Many have taken to the streets in protest, proudly proclaiming, ""I am NOT a sissy!"" while defiantly flouting mask mandates.In response, pro-mask advocates have scoffed at the study, dismissing it as pseudoscience and pointing to overwhelming evidence supporting the efficacy of mask-wearing in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. They argue that wearing a mask is a responsible act of solidarity to protect the vulnerable in society.As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: the connection between wearing a mask and being a big sissy is now hotly contested ground.

There is no try.""""Well, I mean, I'm just going to declare victory over it,"" Hinn explained.""That is why you fail,"" Yoda replied.Yoda set up various training courses in the swamps of Dagobah, from training dummies Hinn would have to try to pickpocket to a whole line of dummies he would have to knock over with his mind.In one horrible training session, Hinn went into a dark cave and was confronted by John MacArthur. ""NOOOOO!!!!"" Hinn screamed, running for his life after he was unable to knock MacArthur down with his Force powers.Yoda shook his head and smacked Hinn with his cane. ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.""""Well, that all sounds pretty bad.

Reports indicate that Hinn was drawn to Dagobah after watching the ""Star Wars"" series, convinced that he too could harness the Force to perform even more miraculous healings and manifestations.Upon arriving on the swampy and remote planet, Hinn was greeted by the diminutive Jedi master, who allegedly took him under his wing (or rather, his pointy ear) to guide him in his quest to harness this newfound ability. Witnesses claim Hinn was seen frantically swinging a lightsaber and attempting to levitate objects with little success, as Yoda patiently watched on, shaking his head in disbelief.In a statement released to his followers back on Earth, Hinn professed his commitment to not only knocking people over in the name of Jesus, but also to levitating them for good measure. ""The power of the Force is strong within me, and I will use it to bring healing and prosperity to all who witness my Jedi-like abilities,"" Hinn declared, much to the confusion of his audience.Critics have been quick to point out the absurdity of Hinn's intergalactic journey, questioning the authenticity of his intentions and the ethics of profiting off such a fantastical spectacle. However, Hinn remains undeterred, insisting that his trip to Dagobah is a divine calling that will ultimately lead to a new era of spiritual enlightenment and entertainment for his devoted followers.As Benny Hinn continues his quest to master the power to knock people over - whether by the hand of God or the hand of Yoda - one thing is for certain: the Force is strong with this one, and so too, apparently, is the desire to make a spectacle of faith.",0.0105791532129048,0.2638,0.3573487031700288,0.0578034682080924,0.1469740634005763

"Write satirical article with headline: ""Trump Replaces Washington Monument With Giant Can Of Goya Beans""",9,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Liberals have been complaining about the Washington Monument, which is named after the notorious racist George Washington. Well, Trump is now appeasing them, having taken down the century-old obelisk, replacing it with a 350-foot-tall can of Goya pinto beans.The authentic Goya can is 350 feet tall and 200 feet wide and contains 82,252,607 gallons of beans.""This is the largest can of Goya beans, maybe ever,"" said President Trump at the dedication ceremony. ""Way bigger than some of the other countries' statues and monuments. This thing makes the Eiffel Tower look laughable. I mean that literally. You look at the Eiffel Tower and you just laugh. It's not even finished. You can still see the frame. And does it have beans? Well, maybe at that snooty French restaurant. But probably not. Probably not. They just have dumb French food like cheese with funny names and bread. Admittedly the bread smells pretty good, but it doesn't live up to that when you eat it. Always smells better than it tastes. Everyone says so.""Liberals tried to criticize the move but were unable to do so since they would be siding with George Washington. Plus, the optics of tearing down a monument to a Latino businessman would just be bad. ""We've been played again,"" said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. ""This guy really is a genius.""","In a move that has left many scratching their heads, President Donald Trump has announced plans to replace the iconic Washington Monument with a massive, towering can of Goya beans.The decision reportedly came after Trump's recent endorsement of the Hispanic-owned food company, which sparked controversy and even led to calls for a boycott. But instead of backing down, the president has doubled down on his support by utterly transforming one of America's most recognized landmarks.The new structure, which has been dubbed the ""Monu-Goya,"" is set to be the tallest can of beans in the world, standing at a staggering 555 feet tall. Visitors will now have the unique opportunity to gaze up at the shimmering aluminum can, complete with a towering label featuring the smiling face of Goya CEO Robert Unanue.In a press conference unveiling the new monument, Trump explained, ""I wanted to honor a great American company and show my unwavering support for Hispanic-owned businesses. What better way to do that than by replacing a stuffy old obelisk with a shiny can of Goya beans? It's going to be huge.”While some supporters of the president have praised the move as a bold statement of patriotism and pro-business values, many have expressed confusion and disbelief at the unconventional choice. Critics have pointed out that Goya beans have little to do with the nation's founding and history, and question the president's priorities in the midst of a pandemic and economic crisis.As construction crews begin the arduous task of dismantling the historic Washington Monument to make way for the Monu-Goya, one thing is certain: Trump's legacy will now forever be linked to a colossal can of beans looming over the nation's capital.

Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?!

The goal was to ensure that the phrase was respectful and inclusive of all marginalized communities, especially indigenous peoples.""We realized that the term 'Chief' could be triggering for some individuals who identify as indigenous,"" explained a spokesperson for the task force behind the change. ""By replacing it with 'Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader', we are empowering and uplifting these communities while also denouncing cultural appropriation and stereotyping.""The update has sparked mixed reactions online, with some applauding the move as a step towards greater inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, while others have criticized it as an unnecessary and absurd attempt at political correctness.Regardless of where you stand on the issue, one thing is clear: the phrase ""This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"" is here to stay.

""After analyzing data from thousands of participants, we can confidently say that those who choose to wear masks are significantly more likely to exhibit sissy-like behavior,"" Dr. Chuckleworthy announced with a smirk.The study discovered that individuals who wear masks tend to have higher levels of empathy, concern for public health, and a general sense of responsibility towards their fellow citizens.

One of his fellow CNN reporters cradled him in her arms and took him out into the cry room with an apologetic look on her face.The cry room may need expanding soon, however, since every single reporter except OANN's Chanel Rion was sent to the cry room during the first press briefing. Rion pointed and laughed at them as they went into the cry room, calling them ""dumb babies,"" which made them cry harder.","In a groundbreaking move to accommodate the delicate sensibilities of the White House press corps, a new ""Cry Room"" has been installed just steps away from the press briefing room. This new addition comes after numerous reports of journalists feeling overwhelmed by the daily stresses of asking tough questions and seeking transparency from the administration.The Cry Room, complete with plush sofas, soothing lavender scented candles, and a stocked mini-bar, aims to provide a safe space for reporters to release their frustrations when facing the harsh realities of holding those in power accountable. Additionally, there will be a designated ""hugger-in-residence"" available at all times to offer emotional support and gentle pats on the back.White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated, ""We understand that the pressure of reporting on the important work of our administration can be overwhelming at times. We hope that the Cry Room will provide a calming environment for our hardworking journalists to decompress and recharge their spirits before returning to the battlefield of investigative journalism.""Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of coddling reporters in such a manner.

As reporters take advantage of this newfound refuge, one can only wonder what other accommodations will be made in the future to shield them from the harsh realities of their profession.In the meantime, journalists can rest easy knowing that the comforting walls of the Cry Room will always be there to catch their tears and soothe their troubled souls in the face of adversity.",0.0046456206029588,0.2286,0.3057324840764331,0.0670926517571885,0.1528662420382165

Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","Ah, what a delightful prompt to sink my satirical teeth into! Let's embark on this journey of whimsical critique and societal observation, shall we?Step 1: IntroductionIn a world where social commentary often comes cleverly packaged in meme form, the evolution of ""This Ain't It, Chief"" to ""This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"" invites us to reflect on the power dynamics and cultural appropriation lurking beneath the surface of online slang. This update serves as a tongue-in-cheek reminder of the need for sensitivity and respect, even in the realm of internet memes.Step 2: Research and ContextDelving into the nuances of cultural appropriation and the commodification of indigenous cultures will be crucial in forming our satirical narrative. By understanding the implications of appropriating marginalized identities for trendy catchphrases, we can craft a more incisive and relevant critique.Step 3: Crafting the NarrativePicture this: a group of social media influencers trying to one-up each other with their woke credentials, deploying the updated meme with misplaced reverence and performative allyship. As they stumble over their own attempts at virtue signaling, we'll expose the superficiality of their understanding and commitment to social justice causes.Step 4: Character DevelopmentOur cast of characters will embody different facets of performative activism – from the influencer who treats social justice as a fashion statement to the corporate brand eager to profit off of the latest social media trends. Through their interactions and missteps, we'll shine a light on the absurdity of virtue signaling without genuine understanding or action.Step 5: Satirical TechniquesSarcasm, irony, and exaggeration will be our trusty companions as we dissect the superficiality of online activism and the emptiness of performative allyship. By juxtaposing the gravity of cultural appropriation with the frivolity of internet memes, we'll reveal the disconnect between intention and impact in today's digital age.Step 6: ConclusionAs we wrap up our satirical exploration, we'll leave readers with a reflective nudge towards authenticity and genuine engagement in allyship efforts. By highlighting the dangers of co-opting marginalized identities for social capital, we hope to inspire a more thoughtful and conscientious approach to social justice advocacy in the online sphere.Let's dive headfirst into the realm of satire, armed with wit, wisdom, and a healthy dose of cheeky irreverence.

No longer will they regale readers with tales of political absurdity or societal chaos; instead, they have pledged to use their prophetic powers for good by exclusively reporting on positive developments in humanity. But can a publication known for its biting wit and sharp commentary really pull off such an altruistic makeover?Step 2: Research and ContextAs we delve into this satirical venture, we find ourselves amidst a whirlwind of headlines dominated by doom and gloom. From political scandals to environmental crises, it seems that negativity has become the currency of news. Against this backdrop, The Babylon Bee's decision to pivot towards optimism carries a weighty significance. By examining the current state of media representation, we can better understand the impact of this bold editorial shift.Step 3: Crafting the NarrativePicture a newsroom buzzing with activity as reporters scramble to uncover heartwarming stories of hope and progress. From puppies being rescued to elderly couples renewing their vows, the once cynical staff of The Babylon Bee now find themselves navigating a brave new world of feel-good journalism.

""Someone could seem perfectly normal, but as soon as they put on a mask, you're all, 'Aww. Is the poor little guy scared of getting the flu?' Total wussification, as it's known in my field.""According to the study, when some of the participants wore masks, Sullivan felt compelled to knock them to the ground and shout names at them. ""And all they did in response,"" Sullivan explained, ""was say, 'Is this part of the experiment?'

By looking at the various perspectives on this issue, we can offer a satirical take on the irrational fear and macho bravado associated with the simple act of protecting oneself and others.**Step 3: Crafting the Narrative**Imagine a world where our protagonist, a confident and suave individual, suddenly finds himself labeled as a ""big sissy"" for choosing to wear a mask. As he navigates this absurd predicament, he encounters a cast of characters embodying the extremes of this nonsensical debate – from the overly macho mask deniers to the timid mask wearers who are ostracized for their choice.**Step 4: Character Development**Our protagonist, let's call him Max Maskington, exudes charm and sophistication but is baffled by the sudden backlash he faces for his responsible mask-wearing habits.

Let's dive into this absurd development and unravel the tangled web of emotions behind it.Step 2: Research and ContextAfter digging into the rationale behind the cry room, it became clear that the increasing tension between the press and the administration led to this novel solution.

Well, Trump is now appeasing them, having taken down the century-old obelisk, replacing it with a 350-foot-tall can of Goya pinto beans.The authentic Goya can is 350 feet tall and 200 feet wide and contains 82,252,607 gallons of beans.""This is the largest can of Goya beans, maybe ever,"" said President Trump at the dedication ceremony. ""Way bigger than some of the other countries' statues and monuments. This thing makes the Eiffel Tower look laughable. I mean that literally. You look at the Eiffel Tower and you just laugh. It's not even finished. You can still see the frame. And does it have beans? Well, maybe at that snooty French restaurant. But probably not. Probably not. They just have dumb French food like cheese with funny names and bread. Admittedly the bread smells pretty good, but it doesn't live up to that when you eat it. Always smells better than it tastes. Everyone says so.""Liberals tried to criticize the move but were unable to do so since they would be siding with George Washington.

Speculation runs rife as to whether this sudden display of clarity was a result of a hack or a momentary lapse in the chaos that usually engulfs the Twitterverse.Step 2: Research and ContextDelving into the tumultuous world of politics and social media, it becomes evident that the notion of a coherent thought emanating from a tweet by a world leader seems more like a fantastical dream than a plausible reality. By examining the nature of online discourse and the unique challenges faced by politicians in navigating the digital landscape, we can uncover the absurdity inherent in this unexpected occurrence.Step 3: Crafting the NarrativeIn a world where Twitter threads resemble verbal brawls more than intellectual debates, the sudden appearance of a tweet that makes sense is akin to stumbling upon a unicorn in a concrete jungle. Through a humorous lens, we can explore the juxtaposition of chaos and clarity, highlighting the stark contrast between the usual online mayhem and this fleeting moment of coherence.Step 4: Character DevelopmentEnter President Biden, a figure caught in the maelstrom of the digital age, where every keystroke is scrutinized and every tweet dissected. Alongside him, an array of Twitter personalities, from trolls to keyboard warriors, who are baffled by the unfamiliar sight of a tweet that doesn't require multiple deciphering attempts.Step 5: Satirical TechniquesThrough the lens of satire, we can amplify the absurdity of the situation by employing sarcasm to underscore the rarity of coherent communication in the online sphere.

""Of all time.""Musk said he had a great conversation with West where he convinced him not to aim too low but instead to ""shoot for the stars.""""Kanye has way more potential than just being president of America,"" Musk said. ""Frankly, being president of the U.S. is beneath him. Mars is where it's at.

This eyebrow-raising development comes hot on the heels of tech mogul Elon Musk's tantalizing offer to make Kanye the President of the Red Planet. Let's delve into this cosmic comedy of errors and explore the interstellar shenanigans that follow.Research and Context:As we navigate through this intergalactic saga, it's essential to understand the gravity (pun intended) of the situation. Delving into the realms of SpaceX's SpaceX's ambitious plans for Mars colonization and Kanye's insatiable hunger for power and attention, we uncover a perfect storm of egos colliding in the vast expanse of the cosmos.Crafting the Narrative:Picture this: Kanye, donning a customized space suit adorned with gold chains and designer logos, struts across the desolate Martian terrain, declaring himself the musical messiah of the Red Planet. Meanwhile, Elon Musk watches from afar, his eyes twinkling with a mix of admiration and concern as Kanye attempts to release a new album titled ""Martian Yeezus: Songs from the Space Time Continuum.""Character Development:Kanye, ever the enigmatic figure, sees Mars as a blank canvas for his avant-garde artistic expression, while Elon Musk, the eccentric entrepreneur, balances his admiration for Kanye's creativity with the realization that perhaps sending a rap superstar to preside over an alien civilization might not be the most prudent decision.Satirical Techniques:Through the lens of satire, we dissect the absurdity of celebrity worship, political grandstanding, and the unchecked ambitions of the ultra-rich. By painting a caricature of Kanye's larger-than-life persona and Elon's lofty aspirations, we shine a spotlight on the surreal intersection of fame, power, and the final frontier.Conclusion:As we bid adieu to this cosmic rollercoaster of a tale, one can't help but ponder the parallels between Earthly politics and the potential perils of interstellar colonization. Perhaps a cautionary tale wrapped in the garish fabrics of fame and fortune, the saga of Kanye West's Martian escapade serves as a poignant reminder of the folly of unchecked ambition and the allure of the unknown.So, dear readers, let us contemplate the celestial spectacle that unfolds before us and remember that sometimes, the stars align in the most peculiar of ways, leaving us to marvel at the cosmic comedy that is life itself.",0.0042563417048454,0.2217,0.2488479262672811,0.0392609699769053,0.1336405529953917

Donning a simple piece of cloth or paper over your face can apparently transform you from a regular Joe into a full-blown wimp.Renowned sissiness researcher Winston Sullivan led the study and was astounded by the results. ""The findings are simply mind-blowing,"" Sullivan proclaimed. ""It's like magic - one minute you're a tough guy, the next minute you've turned into a quivering mass of fear and anxiety just because you're wearing a mask. It's truly a sight to behold.""According to the study, participants who wore masks were subjected to ridicule and taunts from Sullivan himself. ""I couldn't help it,"" Sullivan admitted. ""I saw them with their masks on, and I just had to put them in their place. It was like they were asking for it, being all cautious and responsible. What a bunch of wimps.""Sullivan did acknowledge that there were some exceptions to the mask-sissy connection. ""If you're wearing a mask as part of a ninja costume or some other badass ensemble, then you get a pass,"" Sullivan clarified. ""But if you're just wearing it to protect yourself and others from a deadly virus, well, you might as well be waving a white flag of surrender.""While the study did acknowledge the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, Sullivan was quick to point out that this was a minor detail. ""Sure, masks save lives and stop the spread of disease,"" he acknowledged. ""But at what cost? If you're willing to sacrifice your masculinity and dignity for a little thing like public health, then you probably deserve what's coming to you.""As the debate over mask-wearing rages on, one thing is clear: according to this study, if you want to avoid being labeled a big sissy, you might want to ditch the mask and toughen up. At least, that's what the experts say.",0.042224323925161,0.3874,0.3833333333333333,0.1002785515320334,0.1888888888888888

""So yeah, it's a little less crazy than things out there. We don't worry about stuff like Kanye running for president, murder hornets, nunchuck bears, bubonic squirrels, World War 3, or getting doxxed for old tweets. And they've got lots of great board games in here.""""Plus, Bob's actually a pretty cool guy once you get to know him,"" he added as he adjusted his straitjacket. ""Actually, he's totally sane -- his beliefs make perfect sense to him. There's an internal logic to everything he believes, unlike some of the crazies you try to talk to out there in the crazy world.""","Headline: More People Voluntarily Committing Themselves To Asylums To Escape Insanity Of Real WorldIn a bizarre turn of events, it seems that the real world has become so ludicrous that people are willingly seeking refuge in mental institutions to escape its mind-boggling insanity. The current state of affairs outside the asylum walls has driven many individuals to feign madness and admit themselves to psychiatric wards across the country.""I mean, who wouldn't want to escape from the absolute circus that is the real world right now?"" remarked a newly admitted patient, who insisted on being called Napoleon Bonaparte during his stay. ""I'd much rather be in here discussing my delusions of grandeur with fellow patients than out there dealing with Kanye West's presidential aspirations and the threat of murder hornets.""Reports from inside the asylums reveal a surreal environment where patients believe they are living in a simulation, think they are deities, or engage in activities like playing golf with orderlies. One inmate even claimed, ""It's a little less crazy in here than it is out there. At least we don't have to worry about nunchuck-wielding bears or bubonic squirrels plotting World War 3.""Despite the seemingly eccentric nature of their beliefs, inmates find solace in the fact that the internal logic of their delusions provides a sense of stability that is sorely lacking in the real world. ""Sure, Bob may think he's God, but at least he's consistent in his beliefs,"" one patient pointed out while readjusting his straitjacket. ""Out there, people are changing their minds faster than you can say 'fake news.'""As more and more individuals seek asylum from the madness of everyday life, it raises the question: Are we truly living in a world that is crazier than the confines of a mental institution? Or have we all collectively lost our grip on reality in a desperate attempt to cope with the chaos around us? One thing is for certain - the line between sanity and insanity has never been blurrier.",0.0451862050955119,0.4107,0.3819241982507289,0.131578947368421,0.2011661807580174
