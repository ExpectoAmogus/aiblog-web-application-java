The current state of affairs outside the asylum walls has driven many individuals to feign madness and admit themselves to psychiatric wards across the country.""I mean, who wouldn't want to escape from the absolute circus that is the real world right now?"" remarked a newly admitted patient, who insisted on being called Napoleon Bonaparte during his stay. ""I'd much rather be in here discussing my delusions of grandeur with fellow patients than out there dealing with Kanye West's presidential aspirations and the threat of murder hornets.""Reports from inside the asylums reveal a surreal environment where patients believe they are living in a simulation, think they are deities, or engage in activities like playing golf with orderlies. One inmate even claimed, ""It's a little less crazy in here than it is out there. At least we don't have to worry about nunchuck-wielding bears or bubonic squirrels plotting World War 3.""Despite the seemingly eccentric nature of their beliefs, inmates find solace in the fact that the internal logic of their delusions provides a sense of stability that is sorely lacking in the real world. ""Sure, Bob may think he's God, but at least he's consistent in his beliefs,"" one patient pointed out while readjusting his straitjacket. ""Out there, people are changing their minds faster than you can say 'fake news.'""As more and more individuals seek asylum from the madness of everyday life, it raises the question: Are we truly living in a world that is crazier than the confines of a mental institution?
