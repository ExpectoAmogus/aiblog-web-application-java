"You are a satirical writer. You need to write an article with headline: ""'This Ain’t It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'"".",7,"U.S. - The popular internet comment response ""This ain't it, chief,"" has been rightfully seen by many as problematic for years as it appropriates Native American culture in a derisive way, using the word ""chief,"" which everybody knows is an offensive term. Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","In a bold move to be more sensitive and politically correct, the popular internet phrase ""This Ain’t It, Chief"" has been officially updated to ""This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"".The decision came after a rigorous consultation process with a diverse group of cultural experts, social justice warriors, and woke influencers. The goal was to ensure that the phrase was respectful and inclusive of all marginalized communities, especially indigenous peoples.""We realized that the term 'Chief' could be triggering for some individuals who identify as indigenous,"" explained a spokesperson for the task force behind the change. ""By replacing it with 'Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader', we are empowering and uplifting these communities while also denouncing cultural appropriation and stereotyping.""The update has sparked mixed reactions online, with some applauding the move as a step towards greater inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, while others have criticized it as an unnecessary and absurd attempt at political correctness.Regardless of where you stand on the issue, one thing is clear: the phrase ""This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader"" is here to stay. So next time you want to express your disapproval in a woke and respectful manner, remember to use the updated version - unless you want to face the wrath of the cancel culture warriors.",0.011780270348504613,0.2584,0.3395348837209302,0.12149532710280374,0.1813953488372093

The satirical news site, known for its clever jabs at politicians, celebrities, and absurd cultural trends, has declared that it will now only be publishing articles about positive things happening to humanity.In a press release, the editors of The Babylon Bee explained their decision, stating, ""After years of poking fun at the world around us, we have decided to use our prophetic powers for good.

"You are a satirical writer.

""Someone could seem perfectly normal, but as soon as they put on a mask, you're all, 'Aww. Is the poor little guy scared of getting the flu?' Total wussification, as it's known in my field.""According to the study, when some of the participants wore masks, Sullivan felt compelled to knock them to the ground and shout names at them. ""And all they did in response,"" Sullivan explained, ""was say, 'Is this part of the experiment?' What a bunch of dorks.""Sullivan did say that in certain situations wearing a mask could not make you a sissy, such as if it were ""part of an entire ninja ensemble."" ""But if you don't know kung fu,"" Sullivan said, ""it definitely just makes you a big sissy.""Sullivan did admit the masks were somewhat effective in keeping people from ""infecting each other with the 'rona and dying and stuff,"" which is worth noting if ""you're the sort of nerd who cares about that.""","In groundbreaking news that is sure to rock the scientific community, a recent study has found a shocking correlation between wearing a mask and being a big sissy. The study, conducted by the prestigious Institute of Ridiculous Research (IRR), aimed to explore the possible link between mask-wearing and a lack of courage.According to the study's lead researcher, Dr. Chuckleworthy, the results were clear and conclusive. ""After analyzing data from thousands of participants, we can confidently say that those who choose to wear masks are significantly more likely to exhibit sissy-like behavior,"" Dr. Chuckleworthy announced with a smirk.The study discovered that individuals who wear masks tend to have higher levels of empathy, concern for public health, and a general sense of responsibility towards their fellow citizens. These traits were labeled by the researchers as clear indicators of sissy-like behavior.""We found that individuals who wear masks are often more considerate of others' well-being and are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good,"" Dr. Chuckleworthy added, barely able to contain his laughter.The findings of this study have sparked a heated debate among the public, with many questioning the validity of the research. Some critics argue that the study's conclusions are flawed and its methodology is questionable at best.Nevertheless, the IRR stands by its findings and encourages the public to reconsider their stance on mask-wearing. ""It takes a real tough guy to go out in public without a mask and potentially endanger the health of others,"" Dr. Chuckleworthy remarked, clearly ecstatic about the controversy his research has stirred up.As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: the connection between wearing a mask and being a big sissy is a topic that will continue to divide the masses.

There is no try.""""Well, I mean, I'm just going to declare victory over it,"" Hinn explained.""That is why you fail,"" Yoda replied.Yoda set up various training courses in the swamps of Dagobah, from training dummies Hinn would have to try to pickpocket to a whole line of dummies he would have to knock over with his mind.In one horrible training session, Hinn went into a dark cave and was confronted by John MacArthur. ""NOOOOO!!!!"" Hinn screamed, running for his life after he was unable to knock MacArthur down with his Force powers.Yoda shook his head and smacked Hinn with his cane. ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.""""Well, that all sounds pretty bad.

However, in a recent revelation, Hinn confessed that he feels he has only scratched the surface of his true potential and believes that a pilgrimage to Dagobah is the key to unlocking his powers to a whole new level.""I have long felt a connection to the Force, and I believe that Yoda himself may hold the key to helping me harness my abilities to knock people over with a mere touch,"" Hinn declared in a statement.

"You are a satirical writer. You need to write an article with headline: ""White House Adds Cry Room For Fussy Reporters"".",7,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Trump White House has added a new feature to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room: a separate cry room for fussy reporters who are crying during press briefings and interrupting the proceedings.The quiet, serene room will allow news agencies to take their crying, wailing, fussy reporters into a separate space to calm them down so the press briefings can continue without interruption.""If you notice one of your reporters starting to tear up, just take them into the cry room and soothe them before joining us again,"" said Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. ""There are pictures of Obama, bottles of kombucha, and some Tickle-You-Biden plushies in there to keep them occupied and help them feel safe.""""Hey, wait a minute! Are you saying we're babies!?"" shouted one reporter, tears welling up in his eyes.""Well, yes,"" McEnany replied.""That's... that's mean!"" His lip began to quiver and he was forced to excuse himself to the cry room.""WAAAAHHH!!!"" cried Jim Acosta. ""ORANGE MAN BAD! ORANGE MAN BAD!"" One of his fellow CNN reporters cradled him in her arms and took him out into the cry room with an apologetic look on her face.The cry room may need expanding soon, however, since every single reporter except OANN's Chanel Rion was sent to the cry room during the first press briefing. Rion pointed and laughed at them as they went into the cry room, calling them ""dumb babies,"" which made them cry harder.","In a groundbreaking move to accommodate the delicate sensibilities of the White House press corps, a new ""Cry Room"" has been installed just steps away from the press briefing room. This new addition comes after numerous reports of journalists feeling overwhelmed by the daily stresses of asking tough questions and seeking transparency from the administration.The Cry Room, complete with plush sofas, soothing lavender scented candles, and a stocked mini-bar, aims to provide a safe space for reporters to release their frustrations when facing the harsh realities of holding those in power accountable. Additionally, there will be a designated ""hugger-in-residence"" available at all times to offer emotional support and gentle pats on the back.White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated, ""We understand that the pressure of reporting on the important work of our administration can be overwhelming at times. We hope that the Cry Room will provide a calming environment for our hardworking journalists to decompress and recharge their spirits before returning to the battlefield of investigative journalism.""Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of coddling reporters in such a manner. Some have suggested that instead of providing a Cry Room, the administration should focus on answering tough questions and ensuring transparency to alleviate the stress felt by journalists.Regardless of the controversy, the Cry Room stands as a symbol of the changing times in the White House press corps, where emotional well-being takes precedence over hard-hitting journalism. As reporters take advantage of this newfound refuge, one can only wonder what other accommodations will be made in the future to shield them from the harsh realities of their profession.In the meantime, journalists can rest easy knowing that the comforting walls of the Cry Room will always be there to catch their tears and soothe their troubled souls in the face of adversity.",0.004645620602958818,0.2286,0.3057324840764331,0.0670926517571885,0.15286624203821655

""I mean, can you imagine? It would take at least twice as long and I'd be cleaning paint off the counters for days.""Daniels tried to come up with some menial tasks for the kids, such as putting painter's tape on things that didn't particularly need it, but the children insisted on helping with the core task of painting.""That's when I came up with a brilliant idea,"" Daniels said. ""I told them I was so happy that they were such good children who wanted to help that I'd reward them with a new video game. It cost me sixty bucks, but it took away any desire they had to help anyone with anything.""With the children playing their new video game, Daniels was able to paint in peace, other than his kids occasionally screaming at each other.","In a shocking turn of events, children across the nation have banded together to issue a threat that has struck fear into the hearts of adults everywhere: they are threatening to help.The threat was first made during a local school assembly where a group of elementary school students stood on stage holding brightly colored signs that read, ""We're here to lend a hand"" and ""Don't worry, we've got this."" The sight of these eager young faces filled with a sense of purpose sent waves of panic through the audience.Parents and teachers alike have been left reeling at the prospect of children actually wanting to assist with chores, homework, and other tasks that have been traditionally seen as adult responsibilities.

Some psychologists are urging caution, warning that children offering to help could have long-term negative consequences on the delicate balance of power within households. Others are more optimistic, suggesting that perhaps children helping out could lead to a more harmonious family dynamic.In response to the children's threat, a spokesperson for the National Association of Adults has issued a statement saying, ""We are closely monitoring the situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that the natural order of things is maintained. Adults are fully capable of handling tasks on their own and do not need children interfering with their responsibilities.""Only time will tell how this unprecedented situation will unfold.
