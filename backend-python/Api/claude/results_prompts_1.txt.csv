"Write satirical article with headline: ""'This Ain’t It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain’t It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'""",6,"U.S. - The popular internet comment response ""This ain't it, chief,"" has been rightfully seen by many as problematic for years as it appropriates Native American culture in a derisive way, using the word ""chief,"" which everybody knows is an offensive term. Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","'This Ain't It, Chief' Updated To 'This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader'In a stunning display of cultural sensitivity, the popular internet phrase ""This ain't it, chief"" has been officially updated to ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" The change comes after a group of concerned citizens raised awareness about the potential offensiveness of the original saying.""We realized that using the term 'chief' in such a casual manner was disrespectful to the rich history and traditions of Native American communities,"" said the spokesperson for the newly formed Committee for the Advancement of Politically Correct Idioms (CAPCI). ""By replacing it with 'noble indigenous tribal leader,' we aim to honor the esteemed position these individuals hold within their societies.""The updated phrase has been met with widespread acclaim from virtue signalers across social media platforms. ""I can finally express my disapproval without fear of inadvertently offending anyone,"" tweeted one relieved user. ""This is a groundbreaking moment for online discourse.""However, not everyone is thrilled about the change. Some argue that the new phrase is too cumbersome and lacks the punch of its predecessor. ""By the time I finish typing 'This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader,' the moment has already passed,"" complained one frustrated internet denizen. ""I might as well just write a strongly worded letter instead.""Despite the mixed reactions, CAPCI remains committed to its mission of policing language on the internet. The organization has already set its sights on other potentially problematic phrases, such as ""I can't even"" and ""You do you."" Proposed replacements include ""I am currently unable to process this situation"" and ""I respect your autonomy to make decisions that align with your personal values and beliefs.""As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: The internet will never be the same now that we've collectively decided to prioritize political correctness over brevity and wit. So, the next time you find yourself in a situation that calls for a pithy response, remember to pause and consider the cultural implications of your words. After all, this ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader.",0.03931926110076857,0.3405,0.2647887323943662,0.09322033898305085,0.12394366197183099

""NOOOOO!!!!"" Hinn screamed, running for his life after he was unable to knock MacArthur down with his Force powers.Yoda shook his head and smacked Hinn with his cane.

However, Smith dismissed these concerns, stating, ""We believe that a well-rested and emotionally stable press corps is essential to maintaining the integrity of our democracy. If that means providing them with a place to have a little cry now and then, so be it.""Since the installation of the Cry Room, the White House has reported a significant decrease in the number of emotional outbursts during press briefings.
