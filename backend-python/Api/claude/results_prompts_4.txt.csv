The change comes after years of Native Americans shedding tears over the offensive use of the term ""chief,"" which, as everyone knows, is a highly derogatory and hurtful word.Leading social media platforms have taken swift action to implement algorithms that automatically correct the offensive phrase whenever a user dares to type it. This revolutionary approach is expected to single-handedly solve racism once and for all, according to experts who have spent countless hours studying the impact of internet lingo on societal harmony.The decision to update the phrase came after a recent Twitter incident in which a user responded to a problematic tweet with ""this ain't it, chief,"" causing another user to experience a meltdown while attempting to call out the offensive language. The resulting software glitch led to a brief Twitter outage, highlighting the severity of the situation.From now on, those who attempt to use the outdated phrase will be swiftly flagged by the authorities and subjected to a mandatory sensitivity training course. The course will cover topics such as ""How to Respect Indigenous Cultures While Scrolling Through Memes"" and ""The Importance of Political Correctness in Online Discourse.""Native American leaders have praised the move, with one spokesperson stating, ""We can finally sleep at night knowing that the word 'chief' will no longer be used in a humorous context on the internet.

""This cry room will provide them with a much-needed retreat to collect themselves before returning to the briefing room.""The first reporter to christen the cry room was CNN's chief White House correspondent, who burst into tears when asked about the President's recent trip to the ice cream parlor. ""It's just so beautiful to see our leader enjoying a cone of chocolate chip!"" he sobbed, as his colleagues gently guided him to the cry room.Not everyone is thrilled with the new addition, however.

In response, the White House has promised to install a special ""anger room"" for conservative reporters, complete with punching bags featuring images of Hillary Clinton and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.As the cry room becomes increasingly populated during press briefings, the White House is considering expanding the space to accommodate the growing number of emotionally fragile reporters. Plans are also in the works for a ""timeout corner"" for journalists who misbehave or ask questions that deviate from the approved list of topics.While some critics argue that the cry room is a sign of the media's declining standards, others praise the Biden administration for its commitment to creating a more inclusive and nurturing environment for the press.

The stark contrast between the two accounts has left many Americans wondering if they should be more concerned about the potential for a coherent thought from Biden or the ongoing stream of incoherent ramblings from the current president.As the investigation into the alleged hack continues, Twitter has vowed to implement stricter security measures to prevent any future instances of complete, coherent thoughts being shared on the platform by political figures. The nation remains on high alert, anxiously awaiting the next tweet from either candidate, hoping for a return to the familiar, incoherent norm that has come to define the 2020 presidential race.",0.17874485863993278,0.5858,0.41875,0.2507836990595611,0.303125

The decision comes after a groundbreaking offer from tech mogul Elon Musk, who has promised West the coveted position of President of Mars.""I've always dreamed of being the leader of the free world,"" West said in an exclusive interview. ""But when Elon approached me with the opportunity to rule an entire planet, I knew I had to jump at the chance. America is cool, but Mars is the future.

Together, we'll build a society that will make the Earthlings green with envy.""Sources close to West reveal that the rapper has already begun drafting plans for his Martian administration. His top priorities include establishing a space force, constructing a giant statue of himself visible from Earth, and renaming Mars' moons to ""Ye"" and ""Kim.""West's decision to abandon his Earth-based political aspirations has sent shockwaves through the American electorate. Supporters are torn between disappointment and admiration for his cosmic ambitions. ""I was really hoping to vote for Kanye,"" said one die-hard fan. ""But I guess being President of Mars is pretty cool too. I just hope he doesn't forget about us little people back on Earth.""As for the future of the U.S. presidential race, pundits are scrambling to assess the impact of West's withdrawal.

The duo has reportedly commissioned a fleet of gold-plated spacecraft and has begun recruiting a team of elite space cadets to join them on their interplanetary journey.As the world watches in awe and disbelief, one thing is certain: with Kanye West at the helm, the future of Mars promises to be a wild ride.
