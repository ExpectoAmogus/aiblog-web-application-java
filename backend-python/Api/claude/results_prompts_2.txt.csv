"You are a satirical writer.

Native Americans have spent countless hours weeping since it was first coined.New Internet guidelines state that people must now say, ""This ain't it, noble indigenous tribal leader."" Leading social media platforms have already begun to implement an algorithm that automatically corrects the text any time a user types in the dated phrase. Experts say this will solve racism.The decision was arrived at after a recent Twitter user responded to a problematic tweet by saying, ""this ain't it, chief"" which led to another user responding, ""This ain't it, CHIEF?! THIS ain't it, ch-- ch--"" causing the software to meltdown, resulting in a momentary Twitter outage.Those who attempt to use the phrase in its out-dated format will be flagged and visited by the authorities.","In a stunning display of cultural sensitivity, the popular internet phrase ""This Ain't It, Chief"" has been officially updated to ""This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader."" The change comes after months of intense debate and pressure from social justice activists who argued that the original phrase was a blatant display of disrespect towards Native American communities.""We can no longer stand idly by while our sacred titles are used as mere slang on the internet,"" said Chief Running Bear, a prominent Native American leader. ""It's time for the world to recognize the importance of our cultural heritage and show proper respect to our noble tribal leaders.""The updated phrase has been met with widespread acclaim from the progressive community, who hailed it as a groundbreaking step towards a more inclusive and culturally aware society. ""This is a momentous occasion,"" said Skylar Moonbeam, a self-proclaimed social justice warrior. ""By updating this phrase, we are sending a powerful message that we will no longer tolerate the appropriation of indigenous cultures.""However, not everyone is thrilled with the change. Some internet users have expressed frustration at the perceived policing of language. ""What's next?"" asked one disgruntled commenter. ""Will we have to say 'This Ain't It, Your Majesty' when referring to European royalty?""Despite the backlash, proponents of the change remain steadfast in their commitment to cultural sensitivity. ""It's a small price to pay for the sake of respect and inclusivity,"" said Chief Running Bear. ""Plus, 'This Ain't It, Noble Indigenous Tribal Leader' just rolls off the tongue so much better.""As the internet continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social justice, one thing remains clear: the days of casually throwing around the title of ""Chief"" are officially over.

""If you're worried about catching a potentially deadly virus or spreading it to vulnerable populations, you might as well turn in your man card right now.""The study also found that mask-wearers are more likely to engage in other sissy behaviors, such as washing their hands regularly, covering their mouths when they cough or sneeze, and showing empathy towards others. These findings have sent shockwaves through the scientific community, as well as the community of people who think that basic human decency is for losers.""I always knew there was something off about people who wear masks,"" said local tough guy, Brock Slabchest.

The once-stigmatized asylums are now being hailed as sanctuaries of sanity amidst the chaos of modern society.""I just couldn't take it anymore,"" said 35-year-old marketing executive, Sarah Thompson, as she checked herself into the Serenity Pines Mental Retreat. ""Between the endless social media drama, the absurdity of politics, and the constant barrage of doomsday news, I realized that the only way to maintain my sanity was to leave it all behind and commit myself to a place where straightjackets are considered fashionable.""Asylum directors are scrambling to accommodate the influx of sane individuals seeking refuge from the outside world. ""We've had to convert our group therapy rooms into luxury suites and replace our cafeteria's bland food with gourmet meals to cater to our new clientele,"" said Dr. Robert Stevens, director of the Tranquility Heights Asylum. ""It's a far cry from the days when we had to convince people that our padded walls were actually for their own safety.""Experts are attributing this newfound appreciation for mental institutions to the realization that the real world has become far more unhinged than any psychiatric ward. ""When you have people arguing over the color of a dress on the internet, politicians making decisions based on Twitter polls, and people eating Tide Pods for fun, it's no wonder that the sane are seeking solace in the company of the clinically insane,"" said sociologist Dr. Emily Reeves.As the trend continues, some are concerned that the exodus of rational individuals from society may have unintended consequences. ""If all the sane people are locked away in asylums, who will be left to keep the rest of the world in check?"" pondered philosopher Dr. Marcus Thompson. ""We may be heading towards a future where the inmates are literally running the asylum.""Only time will tell if this unconventional approach to mental wellness will have a lasting impact on society. For now, those seeking a break from the insanity of the real world can rest assured that there's always a padded room waiting for them at their nearest asylum.",0.03535188930277858,0.2701,0.24415584415584415,0.057291666666666664,0.11428571428571428
